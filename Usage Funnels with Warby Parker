/* To help users find their perfect frame, Warby Parker has a Style Quiz that has the following questions:

“What are you looking for?”
“What’s your fit?”
“Which shapes do you like?”
“Which colors do you like?”
“When was your last eye exam?”
The users’ responses are stored in a table called survey.

Select all columns from the first 10 rows. What columns does the table have? */

SELECT *
FROM survey
LIMIT 10;

/* Users will “give up” at different points in the survey. Let’s analyze how many users move from Question 1 to Question 2, etc.

Create a quiz funnel using the GROUP BY command.

What is the number of responses for each question? */

What are the column names? */

/* We’d like to create a new table with the following layout:

user_id	is_home_try_on	number_of_pairs	is_purchase
4e8118dc	True	3	False
291f1cca	True	5	False
75122300	False	NULL	False

Each row will represent a single user from the browse table:

If the user has any entries in home_try_on, then is_home_try_on will be True.
number_of_pairs comes from home_try_on table
If the user has any entries in purchase, then is_purchase will be True.
Use a LEFT JOIN to combine the three tables, starting with the top of the funnel (quiz) and ending with the bottom of the funnel (purchase).

Select only the first 10 rows from this table (otherwise, the query will run really slowly). */
