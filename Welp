/*To practice what you’ve learned about joining multiple tables, you are going to use data from an exciting app called Welp. Users love Welp because it allows them to leave reviews of businesses in their city and see how other people reviewed the businesses. 

For this project, you will be working with two tables:

places
reviews
Let’s get started!

Let’s see what these tables contain by running the following commands:*/

SELECT *
FROM places;

SELECT *
FROM reviews;


/* If each dollar sign ($) represents $10, how could you find all places that cost $20 or less? */

SELECT * 
FROM places
WHERE price_point = '$' 
  OR price_point = '$$';

/* What columns can be used to JOIN these two tables? - foreign key in this exercise is place_id in the reviews table because the foreign key is the unique identifier that matches with an id in an outside table*/


/*Let’s explore how the places on Welp stand up to reviewers.

Write a query to do an INNER JOIN on the two tables to show all reviews for restaurants that have at least one review.*/

SELECT *
FROM places
INNER JOIN reviews
  ON places.id = reviews.place_id;

/* You probably noticed all the extra information in your results.

Modify your previous query to select only the most important columns in order to display a log of reviews by selecting the following:

From the places table: name, average_rating
From the reviews table: username, rating, review_date, note */

SELECT places.name, places.average_rating,
reviews.username, reviews.rating,
reviews.review_date, reviews.note
FROM places
INNER JOIN reviews
  ON places.id = reviews.place_id;

/* Now write a query to do a LEFT JOIN on the tables, selecting the same columns as the previous question.

How are the results of this query different? Would this or the INNER JOIN be more useful for a log of reviews?  - Results are different because they include the results of two null ratings that were not included in the Inner Join */

SELECT places.name, places.average_rating,
reviews.username, reviews.rating,
reviews.review_date, reviews.note
FROM places
LEFT JOIN reviews
  ON places.id = reviews.place_id;

/* What about the places without reviews in our dataset?

Write a query to find all the ids of places that currently do not have any reviews in our reviews table. */

SELECT places.id, places.name
FROM places 
LEFT JOIN reviews 
   ON places.id = reviews.place_id
WHERE reviews.place_id IS NULL;

/*Sometimes on Welp, there are some old reviews that aren’t useful anymore.

Write a query using the WITH clause to select all the reviews that happened in 2020. JOIN the places to your WITH query to see a log of all reviews from 2020.

(This will use the WITH clause as well as the strftime() function. See if you can use Google to dig up some information about the function before take a look at the hint.) */

WITH reviews2020 as (
SELECT *
FROM reviews
WHERE strftime("%Y", review_date) = '2020'
)
SELECT * 
FROM reviews2020
JOIN places 
 ON reviews2020.place_id = places.id;

/*
Businesses want to be on the lookout for …ahem… difficult reviewers. Write a query that finds the reviewer with the most reviews that are BELOW the average rating for places.*/

SELECT reviews.username,
COUNT (*) 
FROM reviews
JOIN places
ON reviews.place_id = places.id
WHERE reviews.rating < (SELECT AVG (average_rating) FROM places)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;
